# ðŸŒŠ Guidelines

Software development generally involves many small steps that can accelerate the development of a project. Through guidelines, we will generate and document basic and consistent knowledge that involves good practices in general, from situations that we have observed in our years of practice building engineering solutions.


## Great ideas to discuss! 

* Kubernetes Basics: 

About Kubernetes basics. When it comes to managing a running cluster, there are essential factors that you cannot afford to overlook. These include ensuring that the cluster is properly configured, monitoring the performance of the nodes, and managing the resources of the cluster. To guarantee the smooth running of your applications, it is crucial to pay close attention to the basics.

* Organization Setup: 

Moving on to organization setup, it is imperative to have a robust and scalable system that can handle various challenges that arise in a team setting. For example, the hiring of new employees, the termination of an employee, or the transfer of employees to different teams can be tricky to manage without proper organization. Additionally, access control, stack control, and billing per team must be carefully thought out to avoid any unnecessary complications.

Moreover, providing secure access to private endpoints, databases, and cloud stacks is critical to maintaining the integrity of your organization's infrastructure. This involves implementing appropriate access controls and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.
